# Virtual Pet Android App
Introduction

The Virtual Pet Android App is a delightful project developed using Kotlin and Android Studio. Inspired by the classic virtual pet games of the past, this app offers users an interactive experience where they can care for their virtual pet by feeding, playing, and cleaning it. With a user-friendly interface and engaging features, the app aims to provide entertainment and nostalgia to users of all ages. 

Overview

The app consists of two main screens: the Welcome Page and the Main Page. Upon launching the app, users are greeted with a welcoming screen where they can initiate their virtual pet journey by tapping the start button. Once they enter the main page, users can interact with their virtual pet and perform various activities to keep it happy and healthy. The app also allows users to customize their pet's name and provides options to reset the game data.

Welcome Page

The Welcome Page serves as the entry point to the app. It features a visually appealing layout with a vibrant color scheme and a prominent start button positioned at the center of the screen. The purpose of this page is to invite users to begin their virtual pet adventure and set the stage for the interactive experience that awaits them.

Main Page

The Main Page is where the heart of the app lies. Upon tapping the start button on the Welcome Page, users are seamlessly transitioned to this screen, where they can immerse themselves in the world of their virtual pet. The Main Page is divided into several sections:

Pet Image

At the top of the screen, users are greeted by an adorable image of their virtual pet. This dynamic image changes in response to the actions performed by the user, adding a sense of life and personality to the virtual pet.

Action Buttons

Below the pet image, users are presented with three action buttons: Feed, Play, and Clean. These buttons serve as the primary means for users to interact with their virtual pet. Tapping each button triggers a corresponding action, such as feeding the pet, playing with it, or cleaning its surroundings.

Indicators

Adjacent to each action button, users can find indicators that display the number of times each action has been performed. These indicators provide users with feedback on their interactions with the virtual pet, allowing them to track their progress and engagement over time.


Pet Name
In the center of the screen, users have the option to enter a name for their virtual pet. The entered name is displayed prominently on the screen, personalizing the user experience and fostering a sense of connection between the user and their virtual companion.

Clear Button
At the bottom of the screen, users can find a clear button that allows them to reset the app's data. This button provides users with a convenient way to start fresh, clearing the entered pet name and resetting all action counts and the pet's image to their default values.

Conclusion
The Virtual Pet Android App is a charming and engaging project that offers users a nostalgic journey back to the days of virtual pet games. With its intuitive interface, interactive features, and customizable options, the app provides users with an enjoyable and immersive experience that is sure to captivate audiences of all ages. Whether users are looking for a fun distraction or a trip down memory lane, the Virtual Pet Android App is sure to delight and entertain.
